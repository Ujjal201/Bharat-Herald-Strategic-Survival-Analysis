## üìå Problem Statement  

Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper, is struggling to survive in the **post-COVID digital-first media landscape**.  

- Between **2019‚Äì2024**, print circulation plummeted from **1.2M ‚Üí ~560K**.  
- Competitors rapidly shifted to **mobile-first distribution, WhatsApp delivery, and subscription bundles**.  
- Bharat Herald‚Äôs own **digital pilot failed** due to low adoption and poor engagement.  

This project uses **SQL-driven analysis** and a **Power BI dashboard** to:  
- Quantify the scale of circulation and revenue decline.  
- Identify operational & financial weak spots.  
- Recommend a **phased digital transformation roadmap**.

# üì∞ Bharat Herald Strategic Dashboard  

## üìå Overview  
This project provides a **data-driven roadmap** for *Bharat Herald*, one of India‚Äôs largest newspaper groups, to navigate the shift from **print-first** to **digital-first**.  
The analysis combines **SQL-based data modeling** and **Power BI dashboards** to uncover insights on **circulation trends, ad revenues, profitability hubs, and digital readiness**.  

The dashboard is designed for **executives & decision-makers**, helping them identify where to **scale, consolidate, or innovate**.  

---

## üìà Key Findings  

- üìâ **Print Circulation**: Dropped by ~55% in the last 5 years.  
- üìä **Ad Revenue Mix**: Spread across categories ‚Üí safer but harder to optimize.  
- üèÜ **Print Hubs**: Ranchi & Ahmedabad remain profitable, while others drag margins.  
- üåê **Digital Opportunity**: Tier-2 cities (e.g., Kanpur) show high readiness but low engagement.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Execution Gap**: Strong readiness ‚â† Strong adoption ‚Üí digital pilots underperformed.  

---

## üöÄ Recommendations  

- **Short-Term** ‚Üí Double down on Ranchi & Ahmedabad, exit weak print hubs.  
- **Medium-Term** ‚Üí Relaunch digital pilots in **Kanpur & Mumbai** with improved UX & bundled offerings.  
- **Long-Term** ‚Üí Build a **subscription-first model**, powered by **AI personalization** & **WhatsApp-first delivery**.
